Employee Payroll System

Welcome to the Employee Payroll System project in Java! This repository offers a complete example of building a terminal-based payroll system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Through this project, you'll explore how to design and implement abstract classes, concrete subclasses, and apply OOP concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism in Java.

🔍 Project Highlights:
Abstract Employee Class: Serves as the foundation for different employee types, enabling a flexible system structure.
Concrete Subclasses: Includes FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee classes, each with unique salary calculations.
User-Friendly Terminal Interface: Provides an intuitive experience for easy interaction and data management.
Core OOP Concepts: Demonstrates key OOP principles through practical coding examples.
Step-by-Step Guide: Includes detailed instructions to help you understand and implement the system.
